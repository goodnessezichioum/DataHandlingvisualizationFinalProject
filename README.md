# üìä Mental Health Analysis and Visualization Project

**Author:** Goodness Ezichi Okoro Uche Marcus  
**Dataset Size:** 292,364 entries, 16 attributes (e.g., gender, family history, treatment status, and isolation's impact on mental health)

## Project Overview

This project uses data analysis and visualization to examine patterns in mental health, exploring how factors like gender, family history, and isolation impact mental health struggles and treatment-seeking behaviors. The goal is to provide insights that could support understanding and awareness of mental health challenges across demographics.

## Key Objectives

- Identify which demographic groups are most likely to seek mental health treatment.
- Analyze the impact of family history on personal mental health.
- Explore how isolation and indoor time relate to stress levels.

## üìà Key Findings

### Gender and Treatment Seeking
- Females are approximately 32% more likely than males to seek treatment for mental health concerns.

### Family History vs. Personal Challenges
- Contrary to expectations, individuals without a family history of mental health issues show a higher occurrence of personal mental health struggles.
- Those with family history are more likely to seek treatment, possibly due to increased awareness.

### Impact of Isolation on Stress
- More time spent indoors correlates with increased stress levels, highlighting the potential mental health impacts of isolation.

### Treatment Influence on Stress
- Minimal differences in stress levels between those receiving treatment and those not, though treatment appears slightly more common among those reporting high stress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology and Libraries Used

- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data handling and visualization.
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `DataHandlingvisualizationFinalProject.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- `/plots/`: Folder containing key plots and visualizations generated in the project.

## Project Insights

This project highlights the use of data analytics in identifying key mental health trends, underscoring the power of data visualization to interpret behavioral patterns in complex datasets. By understanding these trends, we can better address mental health awareness and support needs.
