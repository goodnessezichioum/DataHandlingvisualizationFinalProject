Mental Health Analysis and Visualization Project

Author: Goodness Ezichi Okoro Uche Marcus

Dataset: Contains 292,364 records with 16 attributes (e.g., gender, family history, treatment, isolation impact on mental health).

Project Overview
This project explores mental health trends through data analysis and visualization, focusing on factors such as gender, family history, and isolation. 
The goal is to understand demographics most affected by mental health issues and the likelihood of seeking treatment. 
This analysis aims to uncover key insights that could aid in understanding mental health challenges better.

Key Objectives
Determine which demographics are more likely to seek mental health treatment.
Explore how family history and isolation impact mental health.
Examine relationships between indoor time and stress levels.


Findings
Gender and Treatment: Females are 32% more likely to seek treatment compared to males.
Family History and Personal Challenges: People with family history of mental health issues are more aware and more likely to seek help.

Indoor Time and Stress: Higher levels of stress correlate with extended indoor time.

Treatment Influence on Stress: Minimal differences in stress levels between those receiving treatment and those not, though treatment appears slightly more common among those reporting high stress.

Technology and Libraries Used

Python Libraries: Pandas for data handling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

Key Techniques: Data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization


Project Insights
This project highlights the use of data analytics in identifying key mental health trends, underscoring the power of data visualization to interpret behavioral patterns in complex datasets. By understanding these trends, we can better address mental health awareness and support needs.
